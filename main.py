"""Project Title:
JSON to Automated Report Generator

Updated Features:
Input: Read a JSON file (e.g., sales_data.json).

Processing:
Parse the JSON data.
Handle missing or malformed data.
Calculate key metrics (e.g., total sales, average sales per category, etc.).

Automation:
Generate a clean, human-readable report summarizing the results.
Save the report as a .txt file. (We‚Äôll scale up to PDF later.)

Optional:
Send the report via email.

2. Set Up the Script:
Use the json module to read and parse the file.
Use Python's built-in functions to process the data.

3. Perform Data Cleaning:
Handle missing fields or incorrect data types with try-except blocks or conditional checks.

4. Perform Data Processing:
Calculate total revenue per category.
Determine the most sold product.
Summarize the total revenue, sales volume, and categories involved.

5. Automate Report Generation:
Write the summary to a .txt file in a formatted style."""
