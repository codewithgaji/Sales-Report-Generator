# Sales-Report-Generator
Welcome to the **Sales Report Generator**! This tool allows you to manage and generate sales reports easily by adding sales data, calculating revenue, and exporting it into a text file. I created this Software to understand how to work with JSON Files better, Check it out, fork it and also feel free to collaborate.

### Features:
- Add new sales data
- View sales records
- Calculate product revenue
- Get Sales summary for the day
- Know the most sold product
- Export sales summary to a downloadable text file
                    

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `json`, `os`, `datetime`, `time` (These are required to run the code smoothly.)

## How to Run Locally:

## Quick Run on Google Colab:
Run the code [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Be0zPCsN_xim_U2QtNHEshxA0TIFuEui?usp=sharing) on colab.

If you are trying to export the sales summary and it keeps loading, stop the code from running and the download will pop up to save your file on your device and submit to your employer/instructor ðŸ˜‰
